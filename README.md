# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
The project simulates CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin). It reads process data from an input file, calculates waiting and turnaround times, and writes results to an output file. It supports preemptive and non-preemptive versions, with user-defined time quantum for Round Robin.
